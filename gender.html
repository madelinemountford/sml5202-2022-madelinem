                        <p></p>
                        <p> These words either are defined by the subject of their gender, for example: the word 'el hombre' means 'the man', which would be masculine as it is describing a man, whereas 'la mujer' is feminine as it decribes a woman.</p>
                        <p>However some words you have to memorise the gender of these words as you learn them.</p>
